Question 1 :
Using the matplotlib.pyplot interface</strong>
<p>There are many ways to use Matplotlib. In this course, we will focus on the pyplot interface, which provides the most flexibility in creating and customizing data visualizations.
Initially, we will use the pyplot interface to create two kinds of objects: Figure objects and Axes objects. 
This course introduces a lot of new concepts, so if you ever need a quick refresher, download the Matplotlib Cheat Sheet and keep it handy!

Solution 1:
# Import the matplotlib.pyplot submodule and name it plt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a Figure and an Axes with plt.subplots
fig, ax = plt.subplots()


# Call the show function to show the result
plt.show()

Question 2 :
Adding data to an Axes object
Adding data to a figure is done by calling methods of the Axes object. In this exercise, we will use the plot method to add data about rainfall in two American cities: Seattle, WA and Austin, TX.
The data are stored in two Pandas DataFrame objects that are already loaded into memory: seattle_weather stores information about the weather in Seattle, and austin_weather stores information about the weather in Austin. Each of the data frames has a MONTHS column that stores the three-letter name of the months. Each also has a column named "MLY-PRCP-NORMAL" that stores the average rainfall in each month during a ten-year period.
In this exercise, you will create a visualization that will allow you to compare the rainfall in these two cities.

Solution 2: 
# Import the matplotlib.pyplot submodule and name it plt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a Figure and an Axes with plt.subplots
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Plot MLY-PRCP-NORMAL from seattle_weather against the MONTH
ax.plot(seattle_weather["MONTH"], seattle_weather["MLY-PRCP-NORMAL"])

# Plot MLY-PRCP-NORMAL from austin_weather against MONTH
ax.plot(austin_weather["MONTH"], austin_weather["MLY-PRCP-NORMAL"])

# Call the show function
plt.show()

Question 3 : Customizing data appearance
We can customize the appearance of data in our plots, while adding the data to the plot, using key-word arguments to the plot command.
In this exercise, you will customize the appearance of the markers, the linestyle that is used, and the color of the lines and markers for your data.
As before, the data is already provided in Pandas DataFrame objects loaded into memory: seattle_weather and austin_weather. These each have a MONTHS column and a "MLY-PRCP-NORMAL" that you will plot against each other.
In addition, a Figure object named fig and an Axes object named ax have already been created for you.

Solution 3 :
# Plot Seattle data, setting data appearance
ax.plot(seattle_weather["MONTH"], seattle_weather["MLY-PRCP-NORMAL"], color= 'b', marker = 'o',linestyle=('--'))

# Plot Austin data, setting data appearance
ax.plot(austin_weather["MONTH"], austin_weather["MLY-PRCP-NORMAL"], color= 'r', marker = 'v',linestyle=('--'))

# Call show to display the resulting plot
plt.show()

Question 4 : Customizing axis labels and adding titles
Customizing the axis labels requires using the set_xlabel and set_ylabel methods of the Axes object. Adding a title uses the set_title method.
In this exercise, you will customize the content of the axis labels and add a title to a plot.
As before, the data is already provided in Pandas DataFrame objects loaded into memory: seattle_weather and austin_weather. These each have a MONTH column and a MLY-PRCP-NORMAL column. These data are plotted against each other in the first two lines of the sample code provided.
In addition, a Figure object named fig and an Axes object named ax have already been created for you.

Solution 4 :
ax.plot(seattle_weather["MONTH"], seattle_weather["MLY-PRCP-NORMAL"])
ax.plot(austin_weather["MONTH"], austin_weather["MLY-PRCP-NORMAL"])

# Customize the x-axis label
ax.set_xlabel("Time (months)")

# Customize the y-axis label
ax.set_ylabel("Precipitation (inches)")

# Add the title
ax.set_title("Weather patterns in Austin and Seattle")

# Display the figure
plt.show()
